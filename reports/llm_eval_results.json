      "answer": "For a time-loop romance set in winter, I'd recommend \"The Map of Tiny Perfect Things\" as your best bet. It's a charming teenage love story about two teens trapped in a time loop who explore the magic of their repeated day together. While it's not explicitly set in winter, it fits your time-loop romance criteria perfectly. As a close second, \"When We First Met\" is another great time-loop romance option that plays with the concept of reliving a pivotal moment to change the outcome.",
